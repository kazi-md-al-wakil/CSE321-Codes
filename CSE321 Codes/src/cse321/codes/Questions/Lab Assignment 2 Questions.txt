Task: 1
Write a shell script which takes 10 integers as input from the user. Then calculate the sum of those integers which are multiple of 2 but not multiple of 8. Print the sum as an output.
	

Task: 2	
First prompt the user for a number.

→ Print “Rasengan” if the number is neither a multiple of 4 nor a multiple of 5 but divisible by 10.

→ Print “Oodama Rasengan” if the number is a multiple of either 5 or 6 but not with both.

Task: 4
Write a shell script that takes 3 integers as input from the user. Depending on some comparisons, you need to carry out three operations: addition ( + ), subtraction ( - ) and multiplication ( * )

Each of these operations will be implemented in separate methods.

If the first number is greater than the second number, do subtraction and print the result.

If the third number is less than the second number, do addition and print the result.

If the second number is equal to the third number, do multiplication and print the result.



Task: 5
write a shell script that will take a number of inputs that the user will take and then sort the inputs. {Hint: to use an array in bash, use this command “$ declare -A my_array”}
